# 📊 ChatGPT Review Sentiment Analysis

## 💡 Project Overview

This project performs a comprehensive analysis of customer reviews on ChatGPT using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It aims to uncover:
- The **sentiment** (positive, neutral, negative) expressed by users
- The **subjectivity** of reviews (opinion vs fact)
- Common **themes and keywords** in user feedback
- **Time-based trends** in user satisfaction

By understanding what users like or dislike, we can derive actionable insights to improve user experience.

## 🧾 Dataset Description

The dataset is a CSV file (`chatgpt_reviews.csv`) with the following columns:
- `Review Id`: Unique identifier for each review
- `Review`: User-written textual feedback
- `Ratings`: Star rating (typically from 1 to 5)
- `Review Date`: Timestamp when the review was posted

## 🛠 Technologies & Libraries Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Python** | Core programming language |
| **Pandas** | Data manipulation and cleaning |
| **Matplotlib & Seaborn** | Visualizations |
| **TextBlob** | Sentiment polarity & subjectivity scoring |
| **WordCloud** | Visualizing top keywords in reviews |

---

## 📈 Key Features

- Cleans and standardizes text data for analysis
- Computes **sentiment polarity** (scale: -1 to +1) and **subjectivity** (scale: 0 to 1)
- Classifies reviews into `Positive`, `Neutral`, or `Negative`
- Creates insightful visualizations:
  - Sentiment distribution chart
  - Sentiment vs Ratings boxplot
  - Word cloud of top positive terms
  - Bar chart of most frequent positive words
  - Time-series trend of average sentiment

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Upload the `chatgpt_reviews.csv` file when prompted
3. Run all code cells sequentially
4. Explore the visual outputs and insights

## 🧠 Insights You Can Derive

- Understand what percentage of users are happy or dissatisfied
- See how sentiment aligns with numeric star ratings
- Find which words people use when praising or complaining
- Track shifts in public opinion over time

---

## 📌 Potential Enhancements

- Integrate advanced NLP with **VADER** or **transformers**
- Add **topic modeling** (e.g., LDA) to group feedback themes
- Train a **custom sentiment classifier** for improved accuracy
- Analyze **geographical or demographic** breakdowns if data permits
