# 📊 ChatGPT Review Sentiment Analysis

## 💡 Project Overview

This project comprehensively analyzes customer reviews on ChatGPT using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It aims to uncover:
- The **sentiment** (positive, neutral, negative) expressed by users
- The **subjectivity** of reviews (opinion vs fact)
- Common **themes and keywords** in user feedback
- **Time-based trends** in user satisfaction

We can derive actionable insights to improve user experience by understanding what users like or dislike.

## 🧾 Dataset Description

The dataset is a CSV file (`chatgpt_reviews.csv`) with the following columns:
- `Review Id`: Unique identifier for each review
- `Review`: User-written textual feedback
- `Ratings`: Star rating (typically from 1 to 5)
- `Review Date`: Timestamp when the review was posted

## 📈 Key Features

- Cleans and standardizes text data for analysis
- Computes **sentiment polarity** (scale: -1 to +1) and **subjectivity** (scale: 0 to 1)
- Classifies reviews into `Positive`, `Neutral`, or `Negative`
- Creates insightful visualizations:
  - Sentiment distribution chart
  - Sentiment vs Ratings boxplot
  - Word cloud of top positive terms
  - Bar chart of most frequent positive words
  - Time-series trend of average sentiment
